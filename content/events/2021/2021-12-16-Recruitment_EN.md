Dear PhD student,

Unfortunately, COVID has taken a huge toll on our activities. We are looking to fix this by injecting new blood into the association.

Whether you want to help organize activities for PhD students of the campus, or just attend them, join us!

We're looking at replacing the current head of the association, as we are finishing our PhDs. Students beginning their first or second year are probably best suited for that task.
It's probably better if you have some preliminary experience in that kind of stuff, but it isn't a hard requirement either.

Help us bring ECLAT to its former glory. Here is what has been done at ECLAT in the past:
* Visits: nuclear power plants, Lyon observatory
* Sport: Ski outings, weekly sport activities https://eclat.ec-lyon.fr/en/pages/assoc2.html
* Social: coffees with snacks, bar outings
* Merchandising: ECL swag such as hoodies, etc
* Helping ECL with organizing its JDOC and CRIEC events
* Helping to collect Postdoc and industry offers for PhD students
* Mediate communication between ECL, the labs and PhD students
* Your activity right here.

Don't hesitate to drop us an e-mail if you are interested.

There is also this little known chat hosted on ECL servers (ecl login), where PhD students get automatically invited in a room: https://chat.ec-lyon.fr/group/ecl_doctorants

Best wishes of success for your PhDs and for the coming year,

Mayeul
