It's April! Trees are blooming, and ÉCLAT coffees are back! Our fellow PhD students are encouraged to come and share some good time around coffee, tea, cake, snacks, and whatever we can find to lure you into comming.

Let's meet at the next __Café ÉCLAT__, and feel free to bring some ideas of activities to share with other students.

<!--The place is the same as usual: the training room at the [Michel Serres library (S3)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/25310922).

Uh, it turns out, no :D-->

We have decided to have the ÉCLAT Coffees in a different lab each month, after a PhD student suggested it to us. This Thursday, please join us at the [INL (F7), room 7121 (which is pink), in the middle of the first floor](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5719726890). How about we do it in your lab next? We'll discuss this as well :)
