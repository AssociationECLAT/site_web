October is coming. We are at the start of a new academic year, and it has been 
far too long since last time we organized a coffee for the PhD students.

We've decided to address this. Our fellow PhD students are encouraged to come 
together at the next __Café ÉCLAT__ on Friday, October 11th 2019 at the [Michel 
Serres library 
(S3)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/25310922#map=19/45.78284/4.76807)'s 
training room, on the ground floor.

The purpose of the event is just to share some good time around coffee, tea, 
cake, snacks, and whatever we can find to lure you into coming. It will be a 
nice opportunity to meet, and plan activities together.

Let's meet on **Friday, October 11th**, and feel free to bring some ideas of
activities to share with other students. And spread the word!
