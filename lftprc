# This is necessary because ECL misconfigured their server to send the cert chain out of
# order, which prevents cert verification
# It might be necessary to change this once in a while (every year?).

# This is secure, as long as the cert was manually checked once before allowing it, and
# will still prevent MITM attacks.
